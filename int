Junior Programmer (1-4 years of experience)

Level 1: Coding Test (30 minutes)
Problem: Implement a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

Sample Input:

javascript
Copy code
const nums = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4];
Sample Output:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(maxDifference(nums)); // Output: 5 (Difference between 7 and 1, or 6 and 1)
Solution:

javascript
Copy code
function maxDifference(nums) {
    if (!nums || nums.length < 2) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    let minNum = nums[0];
    let maxDiff = 0;
    
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, nums[i] - minNum);
        minNum = Math.min(minNum, nums[i]);
    }
    
    return maxDiff;
}

Mid-Level Programmer (4-7 years of experience)

Level 1: Coding Test (30 minutes)
Problem: Implement a function that takes a string representing a sentence as input and returns the most frequent word in the sentence.

Sample Input:

javascript
Copy code
const sentence = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
Sample Output:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(mostFrequentWord(sentence)); // Output: "the" (Appears most frequently in the sentence)
Solution:

javascript
Copy code
function mostFrequentWord(sentence) {
    const words = sentence.toLowerCase().match(/\b\w+\b/g);
    const wordCounts = {};
    
    words.forEach(word => {
        wordCounts[word] = (wordCounts[word] || 0) + 1;
    });
    
    let maxCount = 0;
    let mostFrequentWord = '';
    
    for (const word in wordCounts) {
        if (wordCounts[word] > maxCount) {
            maxCount = wordCounts[word];
            mostFrequentWord = word;

Level 1: Coding Test (30 minutes)
Problem: Implement a function that takes a string representing a mathematical expression as input and evaluates it.

Sample Input:

javascript
Copy code
const expression = "3 + 4 * 2 - ( 5 * 2 )";
Sample Output:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(evaluateExpression(expression)); // Output: 5 (Result of evaluating the expression)
Solution:

javascript
Copy code
function evaluateExpression(expression) {
    const stack = [];
    const operators = new Set(['+', '-', '*', '/']);
    
    const evaluateOperator = (operator, operand2, operand1) => {
        switch (operator) {
            case '+':
                return operand1 + operand2;
            case '-':
                return operand1 - operand2;
            case '*':
                return operand1 * operand2;
            case '/':
                return operand1 / operand2;
        }
    };
    
    expression.split(' ').forEach(token => {
        if (!operators.has(token)) {
            stack.push(parseFloat(token));
        } else {
            const operand2 = stack.pop();
            const operand1 = stack.pop();
            stack.push(evaluateOperator(token, operand2, operand1));
