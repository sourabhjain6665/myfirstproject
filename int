Got it, let's formulate a similar problem:

**Problem:**
You are given an array of integers representing the scores of students in a class. Write a function to find the maximum difference between the scores of any two students in the class.

**Example:**
For example, given the array:

`[87, 92, 78, 90, 65, 87]`

The function should return `27`, as the maximum difference between any two scores in the array is `92 - 65 = 27`.

**Solution:**
Here's a JavaScript function to solve this problem:

```javascript
function maxDifference(scores) {
    if (!scores || scores.length < 2) {
        return null;
    }

    let maxDiff = scores[1] - scores[0];

    for (let i = 0; i < scores.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < scores.length; j++) {
            const diff = scores[j] - scores[i];
            if (diff > maxDiff) {
                maxDiff = diff;
            }
        }
    }

    return maxDiff;
}

const scores = [87, 92, 32, 90, 65, 87];
console.log(maxDifference(scores)); // Output: 60

const scores = [87, 92, 78, 90, 65, 87];
console.log(maxDifference(scores)); // Output: 27

Level 1: Coding Test (30 minutes)
Problem: Implement a function that takes a string representing a sentence as input and returns the most frequent word in the sentence.

Sample Input:

javascript
Copy code
const sentence = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
Sample Output:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(mostFrequentWord(sentence)); // Output: "the" (Appears most frequently in the sentence)
Solution:

javascript
Copy code
function mostFrequentWord(sentence) {
    const words = sentence.toLowerCase().match(/\b\w+\b/g);
    const wordCounts = {};
    
    words.forEach(word => {
        wordCounts[word] = (wordCounts[word] || 0) + 1;
    });
    
    let maxCount = 0;
    let mostFrequentWord = '';
    
    for (const word in wordCounts) {
        if (wordCounts[word] > maxCount) {
            maxCount = wordCounts[word];
            mostFrequentWord = word;
        }
    }
    
    return mostFrequentWord;
}

Problem: Implement a function that takes a string representing a mathematical expression as input and evaluates it.

Sample Input:

javascript
Copy code
const expression = "3 + 4 * 2 - ( 5 * 2 )";
Sample Output:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(evaluateExpression(expression)); // Output: 5 (Result of evaluating the expression)
Solution:

javascript
Copy code
function evaluateExpression(expression) {
    const stack = [];
    const operators = new Set(['+', '-', '*', '/']);
    
    const evaluateOperator = (operator, operand2, operand1) => {
        switch (operator) {
            case '+':
                return operand1 + operand2;
            case '-':
                return operand1 - operand2;
            case '*':
                return operand1 * operand2;
            case '/':
                return operand1 / operand2;
        }
    };
    
    expression.split(' ').forEach(token => {
        if (!operators.has(token)) {
            stack.push(parseFloat(token));
        } else {
            const operand2 = stack.pop();
            const operand1 = stack.pop();
            stack.push(evaluateOperator(token, operand2, operand1));
        }
    });
    
    return stack.pop();
}
